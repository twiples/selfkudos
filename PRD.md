# Self-Kudos: Product Requirements Document

## Vision Statement

Self-Kudos is a personal career development tool that helps professionals measure and celebrate their growth through intrinsic satisfaction rather than external validation. It shifts the focus from "likes" and peer approval to genuine self-reflection on meaningful accomplishments.

---

## Problem Statement

### The Validation Trap
Modern workplace culture, influenced by social media dynamics, has created a generation seeking constant external validation for their work. This manifests as:
- Dependence on praise from managers and peers
- Anxiety when recognition isn't immediate
- Measuring success by visibility rather than impact
- Short-term dopamine hits over long-term fulfillment

### The Alternative: Intrinsic Satisfaction
True career satisfaction comes from:
- Surprising yourself with what you can achieve
- Completing meaningful, challenging work
- Recognizing your own growth over time
- Building lasting confidence that doesn't depend on others

---

## Target Users

**Primary:** Mid-career professionals (30-50 years old) who understand the value of intrinsic motivation and want to model/teach this mindset

**Secondary:** Younger professionals (22-35) who sense something is missing from the "likes-based" approach to career satisfaction

**Tertiary:** Team leads and managers who want to foster intrinsic motivation in their teams

---

## Core Features

### 1. Challenge Journal
**Purpose:** Document meaningful challenges you've taken on

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Challenge Title | Brief description of the challenge |
| Why It Matters | Personal significance (not organizational metrics) |
| Initial Fear/Doubt | What made this feel impossible at first |
| Date Started | When you committed to the challenge |
| Status | Active / Completed / Evolved |

### 2. Growth Milestones
**Purpose:** Track moments of genuine surprise at your own capability

Each milestone captures:
- **The Moment:** What happened that surprised you
- **The Struggle:** What you overcame to get there
- **The Skill Gained:** What you can now do that you couldn't before
- **Private Reflection:** How this changed your self-perception

### 3. Skill Evolution Map
**Purpose:** Visualize your capabilities over time

- Self-assessed skill levels (not peer reviews)
- Areas of growth vs. areas of comfort
- "Stretch zones" where you're currently challenging yourself
- Historical view: "Where I was 1 year ago vs. today"

### 4. Meaningful Work Score (MWS)
**Purpose:** A personal metric for career fulfillment

Weekly/monthly self-assessment based on:
- Did I work on something that matters to me?
- Did I learn something new?
- Did I surprise myself?
- Did I help someone else grow?
- Did I feel challenged (not just busy)?

**Scoring:** 1-5 scale, tracked over time, trend visualization

### 5. Private Wins Log
**Purpose:** A personal record of accomplishments that don't need external validation

- Small victories that only you know the significance of
- "Silent wins" that didn't get recognized but mattered
- Personal bests and broken self-limitations
- NO sharing feature - this is for you alone

### 6. Reflection Prompts
**Purpose:** Guided self-reflection exercises

Weekly prompts such as:
- "What did you do this week that scared you a little?"
- "What would past-you from 5 years ago think of present-you?"
- "What skill did you use this week that you didn't have last year?"
- "What's something you finished that you almost gave up on?"

### 7. The "Impossible Goals" Tracker
**Purpose:** Long-term audacious goals with progress tracking

- Goals that feel impossible when you write them
- Broken into micro-milestones
- Focus on the journey, not the destination
- Reflection space for each milestone reached

## The Invisible Skills Framework

Career growth isn't just about technical competencies or job titles. The most meaningful growth happens in skills that are rarely on a resume but define true professional mastery. Self-Kudos specifically tracks these "invisible skills."

### The Five Dimensions of Invisible Growth

#### 1. Navigation Intelligence
The ability to move through complex organizational and interpersonal landscapes.

| Skill | What It Looks Like |
|-------|-------------------|

| **Organizational Mobilization** | Getting things done across teams without authority |
| **Stakeholder Translation** | Speaking the language of business, product, and tech fluently |
| **Conflict Navigation** | Moving through disagreement without damage |

#### 2. Strategic Judgment
The wisdom to know *what* to do, not just *how* to do it.

| Skill | What It Looks Like |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Progress vs. Perfection** | Knowing when "good enough" is the right answer |

| **Quitting at the Right Time** | Recognizing when to stop, pivot, or walk away |
| **Picking Battles** | Knowing what's worth fighting for and what isn't |

| **Creating Alignment** | Getting people rowing in the same direction |
| **Saying No Gracefully** | Declining without burning bridges |
| **Elevating Others** | Making people around you better |

#### 4. Self-Mastery
The internal work that enables external impact.

| Skill | What It Looks Like |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Emotional Regulation** | Staying steady when things get hard |
| **Ego Management** | Letting go of being right to get the right outcome |
| **Energy Management** | Sustaining performance over the long haul |
| **Recovery from Failure** | Bouncing back with lessons, not baggage |
| **Knowing Your Limits** | Understanding when you're not the right person |

#### 5. Systems Thinking
Seeing the bigger picture and second-order effects.

| **Understanding Incentives** | Knowing why people and systems behave as they do |
| **Simplifying Complexity** | Making the complicated understandable |
| **Knowing What You Don't Know** | Recognizing the edges of your competence |

### Tracking Invisible Skills in Self-Kudos

Unlike hard skills (learned a new programming language), invisible skills are grown through experience and reflection. The app helps users track these through:

**Situation → Behavior → Insight Pattern**
```

## Research-Backed Foundations

Self-Kudos is built on established career development research and psychological frameworks. This section outlines the theoretical foundations.

### The Protean Career Model

The concept of the "protean career" (named after Proteus, the Greek god who could change shape at will) describes careers that are:
- **Self-directed** rather than organization-directed
- **Values-driven** rather than externally motivated
- **Continuously reinvented** as the individual and environment change

Research shows that individuals with a protean career orientation evaluate success not by external rewards but by the degree to which their careers reflect their values and purpose. Self-Kudos is designed specifically for this mindset.

**Key protean characteristics Self-Kudos supports:**
- Continuous self-assessment, self-direction, and self-development
- Internal values as the guidance system for career decisions
- Adaptability in performance and learning demands
- Taking charge of professional development rather than waiting for institutions

### Self-Determination Theory (SDT)

Self-Determination Theory identifies three basic psychological needs that drive intrinsic motivation:

| Need | Description | How Self-Kudos Addresses It |
|------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **Autonomy** | Control over one's own choices and actions | User-directed reflection, no prescribed path |
| **Competence** | Feeling effective and capable | Tracking skill growth, milestone recognition |
| **Relatedness** | Connection to something meaningful | Aligning work with personal values |

Research indicates that when these needs are met, employees experience higher job satisfaction, better performance, and lasting engagement—not from external pressure, but from genuine interest in their work.

### The Four Components of Intrinsic Motivation

Research proposes that four components of intrinsic motivation contribute to career self-management:

1. **Meaningfulness** — Feeling that work matters
2. **Competence** — Confidence in one's abilities
3. **Choice** — Autonomy in how work is done
4. **Progress** — Visible advancement toward goals

Self-Kudos tracks all four through its reflection and milestone features.

### Growth Mindset Integration

Studies show that habitual self-reflection leads to a 23% boost in personal productivity and fosters a growth mindset. Key principles:

- **Challenges as opportunities** — Not obstacles, but chances to learn
- **Failures as data** — Information for improvement, not character judgment
- **Effort as the path** — Mastery comes from work, not innate talent
- **Criticism as input** — Feedback for growth, not personal attack

Self-reflection helps individuals identify fixed mindset beliefs and replace them with growth-oriented perspectives.

### The Resilience Connection

Research from the American Management Association shows that 67% of professionals who engage in regular self-reflection report greater resilience. Self-Kudos builds resilience by:

- Documenting recovery from setbacks
- Tracking growth through difficulty
- Creating evidence of past capability for future challenges
- Building a narrative of continuous improvement

---

## Comprehensive Competency Framework

### The Situation-Behavior-Impact-Learning (SBIL) Framework

For each reflection, users can structure their thinking:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  S - SITUATION                                               │
│  What happened? What was the context?                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  B - BEHAVIOR                                                │
│  What did you do? How did you respond?                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  I - IMPACT                                                  │
│  What was the result? How did it affect others/the outcome?  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  L - LEARNING                                                │
│  What did you learn? What would you do differently?          │
│  How does this compare to how you would have handled it      │
│  a year ago?                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Career Strivings Categories

Research identifies distinct types of career strivings that Self-Kudos helps users track:

- Integration with work tools (Slack, etc.)
- Push notifications
- Gamification (badges, streaks, points)

---

## Success Metrics (Personal, Not Platform)

This app intentionally avoids traditional engagement metrics. Instead, success is measured by:

**For Users:**
- Increased self-awareness about growth
- Reduced anxiety about external validation
- Longer tenure with challenging work
- Ability to articulate personal growth in reviews/interviews

**For the Product:**
- Users return monthly (not daily - we don't want addiction)
- Users report feeling more confident in self-assessments
- Users can point to specific growth when reflecting

---

## Philosophical Foundation

### The Self-Kudos Manifesto

1. **Your growth is yours.** You don't need anyone else to validate what you've learned.

2. **Surprise yourself.** The most meaningful accomplishments are the ones that make you think "I didn't know I could do that."

3. **Compare only to yesterday.** The only competition is with your past self.

4. **Struggle is the signal.** If it was easy, you didn't grow. Embrace the difficulty.

5. **Silent wins count.** Not everything meaningful needs an audience.

6. **Reflection beats reaction.** Take time to understand your growth, don't just chase the next hit.

7. **Intrinsic over extrinsic.** The satisfaction of meaningful work outlasts any amount of applause.

---
