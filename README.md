# Self-Kudos

**Your Growth, Your Validation**

A personal career development tool that helps you measure and celebrate growth through intrinsic satisfaction rather than external validation.

## Philosophy

Self-Kudos is built on the belief that true career satisfaction comes from within—not from likes, praise, or external recognition. The most meaningful accomplishments are the ones that make you think "I didn't know I could do that."

### Core Principles

- **Your growth is yours.** You don't need anyone else to validate what you've learned.
- **Surprise yourself.** The most meaningful accomplishments make you think "I didn't know I could do that."
- **Compare only to yesterday.** The only competition is with your past self.
- **Silent wins count.** Not everything meaningful needs an audience.
- **Reflection beats reaction.** Take time to understand your growth, don't just chase the next hit.

## Features

### Challenge Journal
Document meaningful challenges you're taking on. Track why they matter to you personally, your initial fears, and reflect on your growth.

### Growth Milestones
Capture moments of genuine surprise at your own capability. Record what you struggled with, what skills you gained, and how it changed your self-perception.

### Private Wins Log
A personal record of accomplishments that don't need external validation. Small victories that only you know the significance of.

### Reflection Prompts
Guided self-reflection exercises across multiple categories:
- Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly reviews
- Growth Mindset prompts
- Strategic Judgment prompts
- Leadership prompts
- Resilience prompts
- And more...

### The Invisible Skills Framework
Track growth in skills that don't show up on a resume but define true professional mastery:
- **Navigation Intelligence** — Reading people, navigating ambiguity, organizational mobilization
- **Strategic Judgment** — Progress vs. perfection, outcome focus, knowing when to quit
- **Influence Without Authority** — Building trust, creating alignment, elevating others

- **Systems Thinking** — Connecting dots, anticipating consequences, understanding incentives
